# NYC Bikesharing

### Overview

After performing an exploratory analysis of the bike share program in NYC, we have found sufficient data to inform a piolet program in Des Moines, Iowa. Now we have created a presentation of the data we have found to bring to investors to convince them that our idea is a solid business proposal and worth invesitng in. 


### Results

![Basic Trip Statistics](https://github.com/Olibabba/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Screen%20Shot%202022-07-02%20at%2011.21.47%20PM.png)

In the above image three different charts are displayed. From left to right:

- The first is a simple sum of the Total trips in August
- The pie chart in the middle shows the breakdown of the total trips by gender. (Red is male, blue is female, and yellow is unknown)
- The pie chart on the right shows the breakdown of total trips by user type. (Green is subscriber, red is not a subscriber)

We can see here that the wide majority of bike share participants are males who are subscribed to the service.

![Length of Ride](https://github.com/Olibabba/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Screen%20Shot%202022-07-02%20at%2011.21.57%20PM.png)

These two charts show us the length of time the bikes are used for. The top chart is for all users, and the bottom is broken down by gender. We can see clearly here that most rides are less than 30 minutes long. With a majority falling between 5-10 minutes.

These three charts show us the busiest times of bike use, both which days and which times, with additional breakdowns by gender. 

It is clear from these charts that the bikes are being used primarily as transportation to and from work due to the highest use at 7-9 am and 4-6 pm. There is also very significant use through out the weekend. 

![Bike Usage](https://github.com/Olibabba/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/bike_use.png)

These two charts show us the frequency of bike usage. Reinforcing our previous findings, we can see from the map on the left that most use is in the downtown area. The chart on the right shows that there is a subsection of bikes that are used more frequently than the others (green is less used, red is more used) We know from these two charts that there are higher use areas, and we would be wise to rotate the less used bikes with the more used bikes to spread out the wear an eahc bike.
